I have a few coding side projects. Most of them are on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndrewBennet). Some of them are listed below.

### [Reading List](https://www.readinglistapp.xyz)

An iOS app for iPhone and iPad, to catalogue books and track reading progress. It's free in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reading-list-a-book-tracking-log/id1217139955?mt=8), and [open source](https://github.com/AndrewBennet/readinglist), released under the MIT licence.

### [iStockcheck](https://github.com/AndrewBennet/iStockcheck)

A macOS app which monitors iPhone stock levels in Apple Stores in the UK, and sends notifications when a particular model is in stock at a particular store.

### [Sticks](../sticks)

A puzzle game, hosted on this website. Play against the computer crossing off sticks; the winner is the player who does not cross off the final stick.
